The boot-wrapper is compiled as a standalone binary with a specific kernel and initrd built-in.


The following files need to be linked into the boot wrapper directory:
KERNEL		- point to <boot-wrapper dir>/prebuild/Image
FILESYSTEM	- point to <boot-wrapper dir>/prebuild/filesystem.cpio.gz


Compilation
===========

1)Format of source input file
an input KERNEL can be one of belowing format:
 -zImage (compressed binary)
 -uImage (compressed binary with u-boot header)
 -Image  (uncompressed binary)

2)Alternatively, you may specify the paths for kernel and rootfs on the make command-line:
make KERNEL=<path-to-kernel> FILESYSTEM=<path-to-rootfs>


3)system select
you need to specify the system type in make command-line, for example:
make SYSTEM=sx7


example:
make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- SYSTEM=sx7 KERNEL=../prebuild/Image FILESYSTEM=../prebuild/ramdisk.img.raw.cpio


Running
=======

To run linux-stand-alone.bin:

1)load linux-stand-laone.bin to memory address 0x00000000

2)set PC to bootwrapper entry, which is defined as TEXT_BASE in config-default.mk
